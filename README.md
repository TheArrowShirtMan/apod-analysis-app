A Shiny app to examine the Astronomy Picture of the Day!

Concepts and ideas related to astronomy are challenging for many to engage with.  Happily, NASA provides a friendly entree into the world of astronomy through the astronomy picture of the day (APOD) program.  
This app attempts to summarize some of the trends in the NASA APOD program's twitter profile and send users out to the images to see if they agree with a photo's popularity.

In future, this app should contain some additional trend analysis as well as additional data (currently only limited to 2017).
In addition, this app would benefit hugely from an analysis of Instagram trends as well as color analysis of individual images.
